# MTM6407 Static Site - Michael Volk
This is a static website project developed as part of the MTM6407 – Web Development IV course at Algonquin College. The review website is based on places that I visited in my life, as it demonstrates the use of modern frontend technologies like Strapi, Nuxt, Vue and other wireframes.
